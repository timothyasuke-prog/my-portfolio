                <!-- ADD YOUR JOURNEY STORY HERE -->
                I began my journey into the world of coding in early 2023, driven by curiosity and a desire to build things that could solve real problems. At first, the sheer number of programming languages and frameworks felt overwhelming, but I knew that every expert once started where I was: with a blank screen and endless possibilities. I started small, learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, and slowly built simple web pages to see my ideas come to life. The feeling of turning lines of code into something visible and interactive was exhilarating, and it motivated me to keep going.

As I progressed, I dove into JavaScript, adding interactivity to my websites, and then explored Python to strengthen my backend skills. I discovered frameworks like Flask, which allowed me to connect my front-end designs to real databases and create functional applications. Every small project I completed taught me not only technical skills but also problem-solving, debugging, and the importance of writing clean, maintainable code.

In the latter half of 2023, I expanded my journey into mobile app development. Learning to create apps was both challenging and exciting, as it required thinking about user experience differently and adapting to new tools and environments. I started building small projects, experimenting with UI designs, and understanding how apps communicate with servers. Each app I worked on was a new lesson in patience, creativity, and continuous learning.

Today, my journey continues with bigger ambitions. I am constantly experimenting with new technologies, improving my UI/UX design skills, and working on projects that combine web and app development. What started as a curiosity has become a passion and a purpose: to create meaningful, user-friendly digital experiences. Every line of code I write is a step forward in this ongoing journey of growth, innovation, and exploration.
